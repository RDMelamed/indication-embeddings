## Figures and Tables
[This jupyter notebook](https://github.com/RDMelamed/indication-embeddings/blob/master/figures.ipynb) recreates most of the figures, statistics, and tables in the paper.

## Creating Embeddings 
Please see [this file](https://github.com/RDMelamed/indication-embeddings/blob/master/code/embed_indications.py) to see the Keras code for creating the embeddings. This can be run using the small example data set [skipgrams-example.tgz](https://github.com/RDMelamed/indication-embeddings/blob/master/skipgrams-example.tgz)
